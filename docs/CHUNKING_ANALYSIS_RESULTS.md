# Real Audio Chunking Analysis Results

*Generated from Scout's ring buffer chunk size optimization benchmarking*

## Executive Summary

This analysis compares real audio chunking performance across different chunk sizes using actual Whisper transcription. All quality measurements are against **gold standard transcriptions** generated with the same model processing the full audio file.

### Key Findings
- **1000ms chunks**: Complete failure (100% WER across all recordings)
- **2000ms chunks**: Variable quality (0-37.5% WER)
- **3000ms chunks**: Consistently high quality (0-12.5% WER)
- **Recommended**: 3000ms chunks for production use

## Real Transcription Examples

### Short Recording (3.3s): Chunk Size Comparison

**Gold Standard:** *"Thanks, let's see how that works. Long. you"*

| Chunk Size | Result | Quality Assessment |
|------------|--------|-------------------|
| 1000ms | `""` (empty) | Complete failure - no transcription |
| 2000ms | `"Thanks, let's see how that works. Thanks for watching! ‚ô™‚ô™‚ô™"` | Hallucinations: "Thanks for watching!" and music symbols |
| 3000ms | `"Thanks, let's see how that works. Long Shh."` | Good accuracy with minor end word difference |

### Medium Recording (6.9s): Chunk Size Comparison

**Gold Standard:** *"Okay, well our system doesn't seem to want to use profanity anymore."*

| Chunk Size | Result | Quality Assessment |
|------------|--------|-------------------|
| 1000ms | `""` (empty) | Complete failure - no transcription |
| 2000ms | `"Okay, well our system This system doesn't seem to want to... use profanity anymore."` | Word duplication and insertion artifacts |
| 3000ms | `"Okay, well our system doesn't seem to... want to use profanity anymore."` | Perfect accuracy with minor punctuation variation |

### Long Recording (42.6s): Chunk Size Comparison

**Gold Standard:** *"In addition to that, I'm thinking that there might be actual value in Potentially, I'm not saying this for a fact, but potentially having progressive improvements..."*

| Chunk Size | Word Error Rate | Notable Issues |
|------------|----------------|----------------|
| 1000ms | 100.0% | Complete transcription failure |
| 2000ms | 12.6% | Word substitutions, boundary artifacts |
| 3000ms | 12.6% | Similar error rate but better semantic coherence |

| 2000ms | ~123ms | ‚ö†Ô∏è Variable | Quick drafts only |
| 3000ms | ~134ms | ‚úÖ Reliable | **Recommended for production** |

### Processing Time Analysis

| Recording Category | 1000ms Chunks | 2000ms Chunks | 3000ms Chunks |

## Benchmark Methodology

### Test Setup
- **Model**: Whisper base.en with Core ML acceleration
- **Audio Format**: 32-bit float PCM, 48kHz mono
- **Quality Baseline**: Gold standard transcriptions from full audio processing
- **Metrics**: 
  - Jaccard similarity (word-level, punctuation-normalized)
  - Word Error Rate (WER) using Levenshtein distance
  - Time to first partial result
  - Total processing time

### Quality Calculation
- **Word Normalization**: Punctuation removed, case-insensitive
- **Similarity**: Intersection over union of normalized word sets
- **WER**: Edit distance between normalized word sequences
- **Threshold**: 0.9 similarity recommended for professional use

## Production Recommendations

### Optimal Configuration
```rust
const RING_BUFFER_CHUNK_SIZE_MS: u32 = 3000; // 3 seconds
const QUALITY_THRESHOLD: f64 = 0.9;          // 90% similarity
```

### Quality Assurance
1. **Monitor WER**: Target <15% for production use
2. **Fallback Strategy**: Use full recording transcription for critical applications
3. **User Feedback**: Allow manual quality rating to improve thresholds
4. **Adaptive Chunking**: Consider user patterns for future optimization

### Implementation Notes
- 3000ms chunks provide optimal balance of quality and responsiveness
- 1000ms chunks should never be used in production
- 2000ms chunks acceptable only for non-critical real-time previews
- Quality monitoring essential for maintaining user experience
