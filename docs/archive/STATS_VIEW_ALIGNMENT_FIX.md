# Stats View Alignment Fix Summary

## Issues Addressed

1. **Different left alignment between sections**: The primary stats cards, activity heatmap, secondary stats, and insights sections had different left edges due to inconsistent padding.

2. **Horizontal scrollbar on activity heatmap**: The heatmap was causing unwanted horizontal scrolling.

3. **Inconsistent padding across views**: StatsView had different padding (24px 48px) compared to other views (40px 32px 20px 32px).

4. **Different internal padding**: Various sections had different padding values (20px vs 24px).

## Changes Made

### 1. Standardized View Padding
- Updated StatsView padding from `24px 48px` to `40px 32px 20px 32px` to match RecordView, TranscriptsView, and other main views
- This ensures consistent left/right margins across all pages

### 2. Created Grid Container System
- Added `.stats-grid-container` wrapper to contain all stats sections
- This ensures all child elements align to the same grid

### 3. Unified Component Padding
- Standardized padding to 24px for:
  - Heatmap container
  - Insight cards
  - Metric cards (which already had 24px for primary cards)

### 4. Fixed Heatmap Overflow
- Changed overflow from `visible` to `auto` with custom scrollbar styling
- Added `overflow: hidden` to parent container
- Styled webkit scrollbar to be minimal and match theme

### 5. Legacy Spacing Support
- Created `legacy-spacing-map.css` to map old spacing variables to new 8pt grid system
- Ensures backward compatibility while transitioning to consistent spacing

## Grid Alignment System

All sections now follow this structure:
```
.stats-view (40px 32px 20px 32px padding)
  └── .stats-grid-container (width: 100%, max-width: 1200px)
      ├── .stats-metrics-container (primary)
      ├── .stats-heatmap-container
      ├── .stats-metrics-container (secondary)
      └── .stats-insights
```

## Testing Notes

- All left edges should now align perfectly on the same vertical line
- The heatmap should not cause horizontal scrolling on the page
- Scrollbar appears only within the heatmap grid when needed
- Responsive behavior maintained for mobile views

## Future Considerations

1. Consider migrating all spacing variables to the new `--space-*` system
2. Create a global `.page-container` class for consistent view padding
3. Document the 8pt grid system for future development
