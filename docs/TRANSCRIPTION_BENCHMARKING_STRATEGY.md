# Transcription Strategy Benchmarking Framework

This document outlines a systematic approach to benchmarking Scout's transcription strategies to empirically determine optimal cutoff points and validate performance improvements.

## Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Determine optimal strategy cutoff points** - Is 1.5s, 3s, or 5s the right threshold?
2. **Validate progressive transcription benefits** - Does dual-model approach actually improve UX?
3. **Optimize chunk sizing** - What's the sweet spot for chunk duration?
4. **Measure real-world performance** - How do strategies perform across different scenarios?

### Success Criteria
- **Data-driven decisions** - Replace intuition with empirical evidence
- **Reproducible results** - Consistent benchmarking across different conditions
- **User experience validation** - Quantify perceived performance improvements
- **System optimization** - Identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities

## Benchmark Dataset Design

### Recording Categories

#### **1. Length-Based Segments**
```
Ultra-Short:  0.5s - 2s    (Quick responses, commands)
Short:        2s - 5s      (Brief statements, questions)  
Medium:       5s - 15s     (Sentences, explanations)
Long:         15s - 60s    (Paragraphs, detailed thoughts)
Extended:     60s+         (Long-form dictation, documents)
```

#### **2. Content Type Variations**
```
Technical:    Programming terms, jargon, acronyms
Conversational: Natural speech patterns, filler words
Formal:       Professional language, proper grammar
Creative:     Storytelling, varied vocabulary
Numbers:      Dates, addresses, phone numbers, math
Mixed:        Combination of above types
```

#### **3. Speech Pattern Characteristics**
```
Fast Speech:     >180 WPM (words per minute)
Normal Speech:   120-180 WPM  
Slow Speech:     <120 WPM
Paused Speech:   Natural hesitations, thinking gaps
Continuous:      Steady flow without breaks
Accented:        Non-native speakers, regional accents
```

### Benchmark Audio Creation

└── speakers/
    ├── speaker_001/     # Male, fast speech

    ├── speaker_003/     # Accented English
    └── speaker_004/     # Slow, deliberate
```

#### **Synthetic Test Cases**
```
Edge Cases:
- Single word utterances ("Yes", "No", "Stop")
- Long technical terms ("Kubernetes", "Transcription")  
- Number sequences ("1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10")
- Rapid-fire commands ("Save file, close window, open browser")
- Whispered speech (low volume)
- Background noise scenarios
```

## Benchmarking Infrastructure

### **Automated Testing Framework**

```rust
pub struct TranscriptionBenchmark {
    pub test_name: String,
    pub audio_file: PathBuf,
    pub expected_transcript: String,
    pub metadata: BenchmarkMetadata,
}

pub struct BenchmarkMetadata {
    pub duration_ms: u32,
    pub content_type: ContentType,
    pub speaker_profile: SpeakerProfile,
    pub speech_rate_wpm: f32,
    pub difficulty_level: DifficultyLevel,

    pub chunk_processing_times: Vec<u32>,   // Per-chunk analysis
    pub perceived_latency_ms: u32,          // User-felt delay
}

    pub final_quality_score: f32,           // Overall result quality
}
```

### **Strategy Comparison Framework**

```rust
pub struct StrategyComparison {
    pub strategies: Vec<TranscriptionStrategy>,
    pub test_suite: Vec<TranscriptionBenchmark>,
}

pub enum TranscriptionStrategy {
    ProcessingQueue,
    RingBuffer { chunk_size_ms: u32 },
    Progressive { 
        quick_model: ModelType,
        quality_model: ModelType,
        chunk_size_ms: u32,
    },
    Adaptive {
        initial_strategy: Box<TranscriptionStrategy>,
        fallback_strategy: Box<TranscriptionStrategy>,
        cutoff_threshold_ms: u32,
    },
}

impl StrategyComparison {
    pub async fn run_benchmarks(&self) -> BenchmarkReport {
        let mut results = Vec::new();
        
        for strategy in &self.strategies {
            for test in &self.test_suite {
                let result = self.run_single_benchmark(strategy, test).await;
                results.push(result);
            }
        }
        
        BenchmarkReport::analyze(results)
    }
}
```

## Benchmark Metrics

### **Primary Performance Indicators**

#### **1. Time to First Result (TTFR)**
```
TTFR = Time from audio start to first transcription display

Target Goals:
- Ultra-short (0.5-2s): <200ms TTFR
- Short (2-5s):         <500ms TTFR  
- Medium+ (5s+):        <1000ms TTFR
```

#### **2. Perceived Responsiveness**
```
Responsiveness Score = (Expected_Delay - Actual_Delay) / Expected_Delay

Factors:
- Consistency of timing
- Predictability of results
- Visual feedback quality
- Progress indication accuracy
```

#### **3. Transcription Quality Delta**
```
Quality Delta = Final_Accuracy - Initial_Accuracy

For Progressive Strategies:
- Measure improvement from quick → quality model
- Track which types of improvements are most valuable
- Identify when progressive updates are counterproductive
```

### **Secondary Metrics**

#### **Resource Utilization**
- Memory usage during transcription
- CPU utilization patterns
- GPU usage (if applicable)
- Battery impact on mobile devices

#### **User Experience Simulation**
- Typing interruption scenarios
- Background app switching
- Multiple concurrent recordings
- System under load conditions

## Experimental Design

### **Experiment 1: Optimal Cutoff Point Discovery**

**Hypothesis:** There exists an optimal cutoff point between 1-5 seconds where ring buffer strategy provides the best user experience.

**Test Matrix:**
```
Cutoff Points: [1.0s, 1.5s, 2.0s, 2.5s, 3.0s, 4.0s, 5.0s]
Recording Lengths: [0.5s, 1s, 2s, 3s, 5s, 8s, 15s, 30s, 60s]
Content Types: [Technical, Conversational, Formal, Numbers]
```

**Success Metrics:**
- Time to first result
- Overall transcription accuracy
- User preference scores (simulated)
- System resource efficiency

**Expected Outcomes:**
```
Hypothesis A: 1.5s cutoff optimal for responsiveness
Hypothesis B: 3.0s cutoff optimal for accuracy/performance balance
Hypothesis C: Adaptive cutoff based on speech rate optimal
```

### **Experiment 2: Progressive vs. Single-Pass Validation**

**Hypothesis:** Progressive transcription (quick model → quality model) provides better user experience than single-pass transcription.

**Test Design:**
```
Strategies to Compare:
1. Single-Pass Tiny.en (baseline fast)
2. Single-Pass Medium.en (baseline quality)  
3. Progressive Tiny→Medium (proposed)
4. Progressive Base→Medium (premium option)

Measurements:
- Time to first useful result
- Final transcription accuracy
- Number of beneficial updates
- User satisfaction simulation
```

**Quality Update Analysis:**
- What percentage of progressive updates actually improve the transcript?
- Which types of improvements are most valuable? (punctuation, capitalization, word correction, hallucination removal)
- How often do updates make transcripts worse?

### **Experiment 3: Chunk Size Optimization**

**Hypothesis:** Smaller chunks (1-2s) provide better user experience for real-time feedback without significantly impacting accuracy.

**Test Matrix:**
```
Chunk Sizes: [1.0s, 1.5s, 2.0s, 3.0s, 5.0s]
Recording Types: [Continuous speech, Paused speech, Fast speech, Slow speech]

Measurements:
- Chunk processing overhead
- Boundary word accuracy (words split across chunks)
- Real-time feedback quality
- Total processing time
```

## Implementation Plan

### **Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (Week 1)**

#### **Benchmark Dataset Creation**
```bash
# Collect and organize test recordings
