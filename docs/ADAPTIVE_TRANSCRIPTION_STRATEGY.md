# Adaptive Transcription Strategy
*Future Enhancement: User-Pattern Learning for Optimal Performance*

## Concept Overview

Scout could adapt its transcription strategy based on individual user patterns and recording characteristics, providing personalized optimization over time.

## User Pattern Analysis Framework

```rust
struct UserTranscriptionProfile {
    avg_recording_length_ms: u32,           // Learn typical recording duration
    preferred_responsiveness: ResponsivenessLevel, // Infer from user behavior
    quality_tolerance: f64,                  // Learn from corrections/feedback
    use_case_distribution: UseCaseStats,     // Command vs dictation patterns
    correction_frequency: f64,               // How often user edits results
}

enum ResponsivenessLevel {
    UltraResponsive,  // Values <1s feedback (voice commands)
    Balanced,         // Values 1-2s feedback (notes, emails)  
    QualityFocused,   // Values accuracy over speed (long-form)
}
```

## Adaptive Algorithm Concept

```rust
fn select_optimal_strategy(
    recording_length_estimate: Option<u32>,
    user_profile: &UserTranscriptionProfile,
    current_recording_length: u32,
) -> TranscriptionStrategy {
    match user_profile.avg_recording_length_ms {
        0..=3000 => {
            // Short-recording user: Optimize for responsiveness
            RingBuffer { chunk_size_ms: 1000 }
        }
        3001..=10000 => {
            // Medium-recording user: Balanced approach
            if current_recording_length > 8000 {
                ProcessingQueue // Switch to quality for longer recordings
            } else {
                RingBuffer { chunk_size_ms: 2000 }
            }
        }
        10001.. => {
            // Long-recording user: Quality-focused
            ProcessingQueue // Default to quality, with Ring Buffer preview
        }
    }
}
```

## Learning Mechanisms

### Implicit Learning
- **Recording Length Patterns**: Track user's typical recording durations
- **Correction Behavior**: Monitor how often users edit transcriptions
- **Usage Timing**: Detect time-sensitive vs quality-focused sessions

### Explicit Learning  
- **User Preferences**: Settings for responsiveness vs quality priorities
- **Feedback Loop**: Allow users to rate transcription quality
- **Override Patterns**: Learn when users manually switch strategies

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Profiling
- Track recording length distributions
- Simple heuristics based on duration patterns
- User preference toggles

### Phase 2: Behavioral Learning
- Correction frequency analysis
- Time-of-day/context pattern recognition
- Automatic strategy adjustment suggestions

### Phase 3: Advanced Adaptation
- ML-based pattern recognition
- Predictive strategy selection
- Continuous optimization based on user satisfaction

## User Control Philosophy

**Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple, reveal complexity as needed
- **Beginner**: "Adaptive" mode (Scout decides)
- **Intermediate**: Basic preferences (Speed vs Quality)
- **Advanced**: Fine-grained control (chunk sizes, thresholds)

## Benefits

1. **Personalized Experience**: Each user gets optimized performance for their workflow
2. **Learning System**: Performance improves over time with usage
3. **User Agency**: Clear preferences with ability to override Scout's decisions
4. **Context Awareness**: Different strategies for different use cases

## Future Considerations

- **Privacy**: All learning happens locally, no data sharing
- **Transparency**: Users can see why Scout made strategy decisions  
- **Fallback**: Always maintain manual override capability
- **Export/Import**: Allow users to share optimal configurations
