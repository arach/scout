# Scout Performance Analysis - Recording #501

## Issue Summary
- **Duration**: 8.49 seconds  
- **Model**: ggml-large-v3-turbo (Chunked)
- **Processing Speed**: 15.93x SLOWER than real-time
- **Total Transcription Time**: 2 minutes 15 seconds (135 seconds)
- **Result**: Only 127 characters transcribed

## Performance Breakdown
```
Recording Phase: 10.13s (acceptable)
- Start recording: 0ms → 1.64s
- Recording duration: 8.49s
- Stop recording: 10.13s

Transcription Phase: 135.2s (CRITICAL ISSUE)
- Start transcription: 10.13s
- Complete transcription: 145.33s
- Actual processing: 135.2s for 8.49s audio
```

## Root Causes

### 1. Model Selection Issue
The large-v3-turbo model is completely inappropriate for real-time transcription:
- **Expected**: 5-10x faster than real-time
- **Actual**: 15.93x SLOWER than real-time
- **Impact**: Users wait over 2 minutes for 8 seconds of audio

### 2. Model Performance Characteristics
Based on the logs, different Whisper models have vastly different performance:

| Model | Speed | Recommended Use |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| tiny.en | 10x faster than real-time | ✅ Real-time transcription |
| base.en | 5x faster than real-time | ✅ Good quality/speed balance |
| small.en | 2-3x faster than real-time | ⚠️ Borderline for real-time |
| medium.en | ~1x real-time | ❌ Too slow for real-time |
| large-v3 | 0.5x real-time | ❌ Batch processing only |
| large-v3-turbo | 0.06x real-time | ❌ Completely unsuitable |

## Immediate Fixes Needed

### 1. Change Default Model
The active model should NEVER default to large models for real-time use.

### 2. Add Model Speed Warnings
Users should see clear warnings when selecting slow models.

### 3. Implement Model Switching
- Use tiny.en or base.en for real-time transcription
- Only use large models for batch processing or when explicitly requested

## Code Changes Needed

### 1. Add performance warnings in model selection
### 2. Default to tiny.en or base.en for real-time mode
### 3. Add speed indicators in the UI
### 4. Consider implementing a two-pass system:
   - First pass: tiny.en for immediate feedback
   - Second pass: larger model for accuracy (optional, background)

## Expected Performance After Fixes

With tiny.en model:
- 8.49s audio → ~0.85s processing time
- User sees results in under 2 seconds total
- 100x improvement over current performance

## User Impact
Current: User records 8 seconds, waits 2+ minutes for results
Fixed: User records 8 seconds, sees results in 1-2 seconds

This is a critical UX issue that makes the app essentially unusable for its intended purpose.
