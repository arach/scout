# Webhook Feature Orchestration Guide

## Overview

This document serves as the central orchestration guide for implementing the webhook feature. As the orchestrator, I will coordinate three specialized agents to build this feature efficiently.

## Agent Assignments

### 1. Frontend Engineer Agent (frontend-engineer-arnold)
**Specialization**: React/TypeScript frontend development, component architecture, performance optimization

**Assigned Tasks**:
- Implement webhook settings UI components
- Create webhook log viewer
- Build test functionality interface
- Integrate with backend APIs
- Ensure TypeScript type safety

**Key Files**:
- `/frontend/tasks.md` - Detailed task breakdown
- `/frontend/components.md` - Component specifications
- `/frontend/integration-points.md` - API integration guide

### 2. Backend Engineer Agent (backend-engineer-david)
**Specialization**: Rust systems programming, Tauri integration, database design, API development

**Assigned Tasks**:
- Design and implement webhook database schema
- Build webhook delivery service with retry logic
- Create Tauri command handlers
- Implement transcription event integration
- Handle performance and security

**Key Files**:
- `/backend/tasks.md` - Detailed task breakdown
- `/backend/api-design.md` - API specifications
- `/backend/database-schema.md` - Database design
- `/backend/webhook-service.md` - Service architecture

### 3. Design Engineer Agent (product-designer-jimmy)
**Specialization**: UI/UX design, accessibility, user flows, component design

**Assigned Tasks**:
- Create webhook settings UI mockups
- Design test flow and feedback states
- Build log viewer interface
- Define error states and edge cases
- Ensure accessibility compliance

**Key Files**:
- `/design/tasks.md` - Detailed task breakdown
- `/design/ui-mockups.md` - Visual designs
- `/design/user-flows.md` - User journey maps

## Orchestration Strategy

### Phase 1: Parallel Foundation (Days 1-2)
I will engage all three agents simultaneously to:
- **Design Agent**: Create initial mockups and define user flows
- **Backend Agent**: Design database schema and API contracts
- **Frontend Agent**: Review existing codebase and plan component architecture

**Coordination Points**:
- API contract agreement between Frontend and Backend
- Design system compliance between Design and Frontend
- Performance requirements from Backend to Design

### Phase 2: Implementation Sprint (Days 3-7)
Agents work on core features with regular sync points:

**Daily Coordination**:
- Morning: Review progress and adjust priorities
- Midday: Quick sync on blockers
- Evening: Integration testing prep

**Key Handoffs**:
- Day 3: Design → Frontend (mockups complete)
- Day 4: Backend → Frontend (API endpoints ready)
- Day 6: All → Integration (ready for testing)

### Phase 3: Integration & Polish (Days 8-10)
All agents collaborate on:
- End-to-end testing
- Performance optimization
- Documentation
- Final polish

## Communication Protocol

### Information Sharing
Each agent should:
1. Update their progress in their task files
2. Flag blockers immediately
3. Document decisions and changes
4. Share code snippets for review

### Sync Points
- **API Contract Review**: Backend + Frontend
- **UI Implementation Review**: Design + Frontend
- **Performance Review**: Backend + Frontend
- **Accessibility Review**: Design + Frontend

### Conflict Resolution
- Technical disputes: Escalate to me for arbitration
- Design conflicts: User needs take priority
- Performance vs Features: Set explicit thresholds

## Quality Gates

### Before Integration (Day 7)
- [ ] All unit tests passing
- [ ] API contracts stable
- [ ] UI matches mockups
- [ ] No critical performance issues

### Before Ship (Day 10)
- [ ] End-to-end tests passing
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Accessibility audit passed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

## Agent Context Files

### Frontend Context
```typescript
// Key existing patterns to follow
- Use existing Settings UI components
- Follow Scout's state management patterns
- Maintain TypeScript strict mode
- Use existing error handling utils
```

### Backend Context
```rust
// Key existing patterns to follow
- Use Scout's AppState pattern
- Follow existing error types
- Use async/await with Tokio
- Maintain database transaction safety
```

### Design Context
```
// Key design principles
- VSCode-inspired dark theme
- High contrast for accessibility
- Consistent with existing UI
- Mobile-responsive layouts
```

## Success Criteria

The feature is complete when:
1. Users can add, edit, test, and delete webhooks
2. Webhooks fire reliably on transcription completion
3. Failed deliveries retry automatically
4. Users can debug issues via logs
5. Performance impact is <50ms per transcription
6. All tests pass and documentation is complete

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **Webhook delivery performance**: Backend agent to implement async delivery
- **UI state complexity**: Frontend agent to use proven patterns
- **Large transcript payloads**: Backend agent to implement streaming

### Process Risks
- **API changes mid-development**: Lock down by Day 2
- **Design iterations**: Time-box design phase
- **Integration issues**: Daily integration tests from Day 5

## Next Steps

1. Engage all three agents with their respective task files
2. Facilitate initial API design session
3. Monitor progress and coordinate handoffs
4. Ensure continuous integration from Day 5
5. Lead final review and ship decision
