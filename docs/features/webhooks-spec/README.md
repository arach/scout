# Webhook Feature Implementation

This folder contains all specifications, tasks, and coordination documents for implementing the webhook feature in Scout.

## Overview

The webhook feature enables technical users to configure automatic HTTP callbacks when transcriptions complete, allowing seamless integration with external workflows and automation tools.

## Team Structure

- **Frontend Engineer**: UI components, settings integration, log viewer
- **Backend Engineer**: Webhook service, HTTP client, retry logic, database schema
- **Design Engineer**: UI/UX design, user flows, component styling

## Key Deliverables

1. **Webhook Management UI** - Add, edit, delete, test webhooks
2. **Webhook Delivery Service** - Reliable HTTP delivery with retries
3. **Event Integration** - Hook into transcription completion
4. **Logging System** - Track delivery attempts and failures
5. **Documentation** - User guides and API reference

## Success Criteria

- Users can configure webhooks through the UI
- Webhooks fire reliably on transcription completion
- Failed deliveries are retried automatically
- Users can debug issues through delivery logs
- Feature works without degrading app performance
