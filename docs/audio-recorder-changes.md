# Audio Recording Implementation Changes in recorder.rs

## Overview
The audio recorder module has undergone significant enhancements to improve audio quality, device compatibility, and metadata tracking. The changes focus on preserving native audio formats, handling problematic devices (especially AirPods), and providing comprehensive metadata about the recording environment.

## Key Changes

### 1. Native Format Preservation
- **No More Forced Resampling**: The recorder now preserves the exact hardware sample rate reported by the device, rather than forcing everything to 48kHz
- **Archival Quality**: WAV files are written with the device's native format (sample rate, channels, bit depth) for maximum quality preservation
- **Conversion Deferred**: Any necessary format conversion (e.g., to 16kHz for Whisper) happens during transcription, not recording

### 2. Enhanced Device Detection and Handling

#### Automatic Channel Configuration
- Intelligently detects device stereo capabilities
- Upgrades mono devices to stereo when supported for better quality
- Falls back to mono for devices with uncertain stereo support
- Preserves multi-channel audio exactly as captured

#### Bluetooth Device Handling
- Special detection for AirPods and other Bluetooth devices
- Warnings when AirPods are detected in low-quality mode (8kHz/16kHz)
- Detection of "chipmunk effect" scenarios caused by sample rate mismatches
- Explicit warnings about Bluetooth devices in call mode

### 3. Comprehensive Audio Metadata System

#### New AudioMetadata Structure
- Captures complete device information (name, connection type, default status)
- Records both requested and actual audio configurations
- Tracks configuration mismatches with severity levels
- Stores system information (OS, audio backend)
- Documents any processing applied (e.g., silence padding)

#### Metadata Categories
- **Device Info**: Name, connection type (USB, Bluetooth, Built-in), default status
- **Format Details**: Sample rate, channels, bit depth, buffer configuration
- **Recording Context**: Trigger type (manual, push-to-talk, VAD), VAD status
- **System Info**: OS version, audio backend (CoreAudio, WASAPI, etc.)
- **Configuration Mismatches**: Documents any differences between requested and actual settings

### 4. Improved Buffer Management
- Progressive buffer size selection (128, 256, 512, 1024 samples)
- Starts with lowest latency and falls back as needed
- Device-specific compatibility testing
- Explicit logging of buffer configuration for debugging

### 5. Silence Padding for Short Recordings
- Automatically pads recordings shorter than 1 second to reach 1.1 seconds
- Prevents Whisper transcription failures on very short audio
- Tracks padding amount in metadata
- Preserves original audio integrity while ensuring compatibility

### 6. Enhanced Logging and Diagnostics

#### Device Enumeration
- Lists all available input devices with indices
- Logs detailed device capabilities and supported configurations
- Identifies problematic device configurations

#### Format Logging
- Logs native format preservation details
- Documents exact WAV file specifications
- Tracks first audio callback to verify actual data rates

#### Issue Detection
- Identifies and warns about AirPods in low-quality mode
- Detects potential "chipmunk effect" scenarios
- Provides actionable solutions for common issues

### 7. Audio Level Monitoring Improvements
- Separate monitoring stream that doesn't interfere with recording
- Improved RMS calculation with 40x amplification for better sensitivity
- Smooth level transitions with 0.7/0.3 weighted averaging
- Proper cleanup when transitioning between monitoring and recording

### 8. Thread Synchronization Enhancements
- Added condition variable for recording state changes
- Eliminates race conditions during stop_recording
- Immediate state updates with proper synchronization
- Reduced latency in recording state transitions

## Impact on Audio Quality

### Benefits
1. **Perfect Format Preservation**: No quality loss from unnecessary resampling
2. **Better Device Compatibility**: Handles problematic devices more gracefully
3. **Improved Debugging**: Rich metadata helps diagnose audio issues
4. **Archival Quality**: WAV files preserve the exact hardware format

### Trade-offs
1. **Larger File Sizes**: Native formats may use more disk space than normalized formats
2. **Variable Processing**: Transcription may need to handle various input formats
3. **Device-Dependent Quality**: Output quality depends on hardware capabilities

## Recommendations for Future Work

1. **User Notifications**: Surface device warnings to users (e.g., "AirPods detected in low-quality mode")
2. **Format Preferences**: Allow users to choose between archival (native) and normalized formats
3. **Device Profiles**: Build a database of known problematic devices with specific handling
4. **Real-time Monitoring**: Add UI indicators for audio quality issues during recording
5. **Automatic Fallbacks**: Implement automatic quality adjustments for problematic devices

## Common Issues and Solutions

### AirPods "Chipmunk Effect"
- **Cause**: AirPods report low sample rate (8-24kHz) but deliver 48kHz audio
- **Solution**: Preserve native format, warn user, suggest reconnecting or using wired headphones
- **Code Location**: `recorder.rs` lines 391-399, 415-420

### Bluetooth Audio Quality
- **Cause**: Bluetooth devices often use low-quality codec in call mode
- **Solution**: Detect and warn, preserve native format, recommend wired alternatives
- **Code Location**: `recorder.rs` lines 402-409

### Short Recording Failures
- **Cause**: Whisper fails on recordings shorter than 1 second
- **Solution**: Automatic silence padding to 1.1 seconds, tracked in metadata
- **Code Location**: `recorder.rs` lines 604-649

## Code Architecture

The recorder follows a command-pattern architecture:
- **AudioRecorder**: Public API and state management
- **AudioRecorderWorker**: Background thread handling actual recording
- **RecorderCommand**: Enum-based command system for thread communication
- **Metadata System**: Comprehensive tracking of audio environment

This separation ensures thread safety and allows for non-blocking operations while maintaining precise control over the recording process.

## Global Device Sample Rate Management

### New Global State
```rust
/// Global storage for the current device sample rate
static DEVICE_SAMPLE_RATE: OnceLock<Arc<Mutex<Option<u32>>>> = OnceLock::new();
```

This provides a thread-safe way to share the current recording device's sample rate across the application, particularly important for transcription strategies that need to know the actual hardware rate.

### Key Functions

#### `get_current_device_sample_rate() -> Option<u32>`
- Retrieves the cached device sample rate
- Uses `try_lock` to avoid blocking
- Returns `None` if no rate is cached or mutex is locked
- Used by transcription strategies to avoid hardcoding 48kHz assumptions

#### `update_device_sample_rate(sample_rate: u32)`
- Called by the audio recorder when starting a recording
- Updates the global cache with the actual device sample rate
- Thread-safe with proper mutex handling
- Logs updates for debugging

### Integration with Recording Workflow

1. **Recording Start**: 
   - Audio recorder detects actual hardware sample rate
   - Calls `update_device_sample_rate()` to cache the value
   - Sample rate is available globally for other components

2. **Transcription Strategy Selection**:
   - Strategies can call `get_current_device_sample_rate()`
   - Allows dynamic adaptation to device capabilities
   - Prevents hardcoded assumptions about audio format

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Strategies can choose optimal processing based on actual sample rate
   - e.g., Skip unnecessary resampling if device is already at 16kHz

## Command Handlers

### `start_recording` Command
- Accepts optional `device_name` parameter for specific device selection
- Integrates with recording workflow
- Plays start sound via `SoundPlayer`
- Updates UI state and tray menu
- Stores current recording filename

### `stop_recording` Command
- Uses recording workflow to properly stop recording
- Plays stop sound
- Transitions to processing state for transcription
- Handles native overlay updates on macOS

## Audio Playback Commands

### `get_audio_data_for_playback`
- Reads WAV files and preserves their native format
- Logs detailed WAV specifications for debugging
- Converts non-WAV files using AudioConverter
- Returns raw bytes for frontend playback

### `get_audio_file_info`
- Provides detailed metadata about audio files
- Returns sample rate, channels, bit depth, duration
- Essential for frontend to properly play native format audio

## Recording Workflow Integration

The `RecordingWorkflow` struct in `recording_workflow.rs` coordinates:

1. **Session Management**:
   - Generates unique session IDs
   - Tracks recording start time
   - Manages app context capture (macOS)

2. **Transcription Context**:
   - Initializes real-time transcription
   - Falls back to traditional processing if needed
   - Integrates with performance tracking

3. **Audio Metadata Flow**:
   - Captures device information at recording start
   - Passes metadata through to transcription
   - Stores in database for later retrieval

## Performance Tracking

The recording workflow now includes comprehensive performance tracking:
- Session start/stop events
- App context capture timing
- Transcription initialization
- Fallback strategy usage

This data helps identify bottlenecks and optimize the recording pipeline.
