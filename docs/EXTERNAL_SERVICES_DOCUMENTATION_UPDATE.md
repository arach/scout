## Key Themes Across Documentation

### 1. Clear Mode Distinction
All documentation clearly distinguishes between:
- **Integrated Mode**: Simple, built-in, zero-config
- **Advanced Mode**: External service, more models, better performance

### 2. Performance Benefits
Consistently highlighted performance improvements:
- 3x faster on Apple Silicon with Parakeet MLX
- Parallel processing capabilities
- Sub-200ms latency achievements

### 3. Privacy-First Messaging
Emphasized throughout that even with distributed architecture:
- Everything remains 100% local
- No cloud dependencies
- No telemetry or tracking
- User maintains complete control

### 4. Progressive Disclosure
Documentation structured for different audiences:
- Quick start for users who just want it to work
- Technical details for developers
- Architecture diagrams for system designers
- Code examples for integrators

### 5. Practical Guidance
Each document includes:
- When to use each mode
- How to set up and configure
- Performance expectations
- Troubleshooting steps
- Next actions
