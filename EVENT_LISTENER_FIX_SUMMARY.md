# Event Listener Fix Summary

## What We Fixed

The "undefined is not an object (evaluating 'listeners[eventId].handlerId')" errors were caused by improper cleanup of Tauri event listeners throughout the app.

### Solution Implemented

1. **Created Safe Event Listener Utility** (`src/lib/safeEventListener.ts`):
   - `safeEventListen()` - Wraps Tauri's `listen()` with proper error handling
   - `cleanupListeners()` - Safely cleans up multiple listeners
   - Returns no-op functions if listener setup fails

2. **Updated All Hooks to Use Safe Listeners**:
   - `useTranscriptEvents` - All 5 event listeners updated
   - `useProcessingStatus` - Both event listeners updated
   - `useNativeOverlay` - All 3 event listeners updated  
   - `useRecording` - All 5 event listeners updated
   - `App.tsx` - Both main event listeners updated

3. **Fixed Onboarding Flow**:
   - Updated model download progress listener
   - Added visual welcome screen with soundwave image
   - Prevented event listeners from running during onboarding

### Key Changes

- Replaced all `listen()` calls with `safeEventListen()`
- Replaced complex cleanup logic with simple `cleanupListeners()` calls
- Added checks to skip event listener setup when callbacks are undefined
- Proper error handling prevents crashes from failed listener cleanup

### To Complete Setup

Copy the soundwave image:
```bash
cp ~/Downloads/u6753973454_a_soundwave_representing_a_human_voice_speaking_i_59bacfe3-a5a4-4e03-81d8-6def96567432_0\ \(1\).png src/assets/soundwave.png 
```

### Testing Onboarding

1. Clear localStorage: `localStorage.removeItem('scout-onboarding-complete')`
2. Refresh the app
3. You should see the beautiful welcome screen with minimal console errors!

The event listener errors should now be completely eliminated or greatly reduced.
