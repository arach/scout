# Copy Image for Onboarding Visual

Please copy the soundwave image to the Scout project:

```bash
cp ~/Downloads/u6753973454_a_soundwave_representing_a_human_voice_speaking_i_59bacfe3-a5a4-4e03-81d8-6def96567432_0\ \(1\).png src/assets/soundwave-visual.png
```

This beautiful glass dome soundwave visual will appear in the welcome screen of the onboarding flow!

## What's New:
- Added a welcoming hero image with gentle floating animation
- Large "Welcome to Scout!" title
- Subtitle emphasizing local voice transcription
- Smooth fade-in animations for all elements
- Enhanced button styling with shadow effects

The onboarding now has a much more visual and welcoming first impression!
