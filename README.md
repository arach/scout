## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or later)
- pnpm (v8 or later) - Install with `npm install -g pnpm`
- Rust (latest stable)
- CMake (for building whisper.cpp)
- macOS, Windows, or Linux

## Installation

### Option 1: Download Pre-built Release (Recommended)

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/arach/scout/releases)
   - **macOS (Apple Silicon)**: `Scout_0.4.0_aarch64.dmg`
   - **macOS (Intel)**: `Scout_0.4.0_x86_64.dmg`

2. Open the DMG file and drag Scout to your Applications folder

3. On first launch, you'll need to download Whisper models:
   - Open Scout
   - Go to Settings â†’ Transcription Models
   - Download at least one model (Base recommended for starting)

**Note for macOS**: You may need to right-click and select "Open" the first time to bypass Gatekeeper if the app isn't code-signed.

### Option 2: Build from Source

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/arach/scout.git
cd scout
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Download Whisper models:
```bash
./scripts/download-models.sh
```

4. Run in development mode:
```bash
pnpm tauri dev
```

## Building

To build for production:

```bash
pnpm tauri build
```

This will create platform-specific binaries in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.

## Usage

1. Launch the application
2. Click the "Start Recording" button or use the global hotkey (Cmd+Shift+Space)
3. Speak clearly into your microphone
4. The native overlay shows recording status
5. Click "Stop Recording" or press the hotkey again to end recording
6. The transcript will appear automatically after processing

### File Upload
1. Drag and drop audio files onto the recording area, or
2. Click "Upload Audio File" to select files

   - **Small (244MB)**: Better accuracy, slower processing
   - **Medium (769MB)**: High accuracy
   - **Large (1550MB)**: Best accuracy, slowest
3. Switch between models by clicking "Use This Model"
4. The active model is shown with a green "Active" badge

#### External Service Models (Advanced Mode)
For enhanced performance and additional model options:
1. Install the [Scout Transcriber Service](transcriber/README.md)
2. Open Settings â†’ Transcription â†’ Switch to "Advanced Mode"

## Development

### Essential Commands

```bash
# Development
pnpm dev              # Start Vite dev server  
pnpm tauri dev        # Run full app in development mode

# Build
pnpm build            # TypeScript + Vite build
pnpm tauri build      # Build production binaries

# Setup
./scripts/download-models.sh  # Download Whisper models (required)

# Testing
cd src-tauri && cargo test    # Run Rust tests
```

### Running Tests

Scout has comprehensive test coverage with 97.6% success rate (163/167 tests passing):

```bash
# Frontend tests (Vitest + React Testing Library)
pnpm test

# Rust tests  
cd src-tauri
cargo test

# Run tests with coverage
pnpm test --coverage
```

### Code Style

- Frontend: ESLint and Prettier
- Backend: rustfmt and clippy

## Performance Targets

### Integrated Mode (Built-in Whisper)
- User-perceived latency: <300ms
- Memory usage: <215MB for base model
- Processing efficiency: 0.1-0.5 RTF for small models

### Advanced Mode (External Service)
- User-perceived latency: <200ms with Parakeet MLX
- Parallel processing: 2-8 concurrent transcriptions
- Memory usage: ~500MB base + 200MB per worker
- Processing efficiency: 0.03-0.1 RTF with optimized models
- Automatic failover to built-in mode if service unavailable

## Security Considerations

- All processing is done locally
- No network requests for transcription
- Audio files are stored temporarily and deleted after processing
- Database is stored in the app's local data directory
