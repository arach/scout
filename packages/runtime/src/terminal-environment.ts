 * Pane identity a terminal multiplexer exports to everything running inside

 *
 * Same class of leak as the Claude markers, one layer down. A Scout process
 * started from a herdr pane (or a tmux/zellij one) carries that pane's
 * identity for its whole life, and hands it to every terminal it spawns. In a
 * Scout tile that identity is a lie — the tile is a new top-level terminal,
 * not a pane inside the session Scout happened to be launched from — and it
 * breaks two things:
 *
 *   - The multiplexer client refuses to start. herdr answers `nested herdr is
 *     disabled by default` (its `[experimental] allow_nested` guard) and tmux
 *     answers `sessions should be nested with care`, so a session that
 *     attaches fine from any other terminal cannot be attached in a tile.
 *   - An agent in the tile believes it lives in the ORIGINAL pane. herdr's own
 *     skill gates on `HERDR_ENV=1`, so the check passes and the agent then
 *     drives whatever `HERDR_PANE_ID` names — the pane Scout was launched
 *     from, not its own.
 *
 * Scrubbed from the environment handed to a multiplexer CLIENT only. The
 * multiplexer sets these again, correctly, for the pane it creates, which is
 * why {@link buildInteractiveTerminalShellDirectives} — those run INSIDE such
 * a pane — must not unset them.
 *
 * Keep in sync with `ScoutTerminalLaunchCommand` on the macOS side.
