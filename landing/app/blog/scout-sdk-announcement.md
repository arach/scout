# Introducing Scout SDK: The Voice Layer for Desktop Apps

*January 30, 2025*

Today we're excited to announce Scout SDK ‚Äî an embeddable voice layer that brings intelligent, local-first voice capabilities to any desktop application. 

## The Problem

Every modern productivity app needs voice input. Users expect to talk to their tools like they talk to Siri or Alexa. But building good voice UX is incredibly hard:

- Recording audio with proper buffering
- Managing system permissions and hotkeys  
- Creating beautiful, responsive UI overlays
- Integrating transcription engines
- Handling errors gracefully
- Making it feel native to YOUR app

Most teams either skip voice entirely or ship a subpar experience.

## Enter Scout SDK

Scout SDK is a complete voice layer you can embed in your app in minutes. One line of code gives you:

- üéôÔ∏è **Beautiful native overlay** themed to match your app
- ‚å®Ô∏è **Global hotkey activation** (Cmd+Shift+Space by default)
- üîÑ **Ring buffer recording** to capture speech before activation
- üß† **Local Whisper transcription** with <300ms latency
- üé® **Customizable everything** ‚Äî UI, sounds, behaviors

```typescript
import Scout from '@scout/sdk';

Scout.init({
  theme: 'claude',
  onTranscribe: (text) => {
    // Send to your LLM or process locally
  }
});
```

That's it. Your app now has world-class voice input.
