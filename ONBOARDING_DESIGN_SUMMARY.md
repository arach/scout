# Scout Onboarding Design Summary

## Visual Design

We've created a stunning, professional onboarding experience with:

### Typography
- **Silkscreen font** for the "WELCOME" title - giving it that tech-futuristic vibe
- **Inter font** for all body text - clean, modern, and highly readable
- Font weights from 300-700 for proper hierarchy

### Hero Image Treatment
- **Full-bleed design** - image spans the full width of the modal
- **400px height** to showcase the soundwave visual without cutting it off
- **Gradient overlays** to ensure text readability over the image
- **No animations** on the image - clean and professional

### Color Scheme
- Dark, sophisticated background (95% black with 20px blur)
- White text on dark for high contrast
- Glass-morphism effects on the model info box
- Green checkmarks (#4ade80) for feature list
- White CTA button that pops against the dark background

### Layout
- **900px max width** for a more cinematic feel
- Content positioned at the bottom of the image with gradient fade
- Generous padding (60px) for breathing room
- Staggered fade-in animations (0.2s, 0.3s, 0.4s delays)

### Professional Touches
- Subtle box shadow on the modal with white border glow
- High-quality backdrop blur effect
- Smooth cubic-bezier transitions
